      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been a musician most of my life but now I want to learn some other skills.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Chico, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to scuba dive and cross stitch.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm still figuring that out. I know now that it's not being a freelance musician.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Super close to UM.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I coded a website when I was 10 called "Rhonda's World" and I thought it was so cool! I hope this brings me back to those feelings of wonder and amazement when making small changes in code made big changes in appearance!</p>
